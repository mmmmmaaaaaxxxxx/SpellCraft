# VERY IMPORTANT
I accidentally pushed files to the outside of the data file because it didnt' let me upload my whole pack at one because it doesn't allow for more than 100 files. I do not know how to revert changes, so please use the version from before the changes made on December 15

# SpellCraft
Minecraft datapack that adds extremely customizable magic spells

# How to use
Run /function noi:altar/place to place your altar and /function noi:givewand to get a wand. Clicking the wand casts it's spell, but right now that isnt anything. To give it a spell, click the wand into the enchanting particles that the altar function created, this will place the wand and spawn particles to its right. Placing items into the new particles and clicking again on the wand will give you the wand but now with a spell. All of the spells in the wand run from right to left every time you use the wand, triggering the next one in different ways. Leaving a space in between spells causes spells to the left of the space to not run.

Only some items can be placed into the new particles because those are the only spells that I have coded in so far. Those item are: dirt, snow block, oak planks, gunpowder, iron ingot, and tnt. I will leave it up to you to figure out what all of those do!
